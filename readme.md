## Emotional Quotient Identification through Facebook Posts


## Overview

This project focuses on identifying the emotional quotient of young people during their adolescence period by analyzing their Facebook posts. Adolescence is a challenging time, often associated with emotional and socioeconomic pressures that can lead to depression, dangerous conduct, substance misuse, and self-harm.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to leverage social media data, specifically Facebook posts, to gain insights into the emotional well-being of young individuals. By analyzing the content they share on social media, we aim to identify patterns and indicators related to their emotional state.

## Features
* Text Analysis: Utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the text content of Facebook posts.
* Sentiment Analysis: Implement sentiment analysis algorithms to gauge the emotional tone of the posts.
* Keyword Extraction: Identify key words or phrases that may indicate specific emotions, struggles, or challenges.
* Machine Learning Models: Develop machine learning models to classify posts into different emotional categories.
Data Collection
Data will be collected from publicly available Facebook posts of young individuals. Ethical considerations and privacy will be prioritized, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and guidelines.

## Usage
* Data Collection: Obtain Facebook posts data from willing participants or public profiles.
* Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to remove irrelevant information and ensure anonymity.
* Model Training: Train machine learning models using labeled data to classify posts based on emotional categories.
* Analysis: Analyze the results to draw insights into the emotional quotient of the target demographic.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
Machine learning frameworks (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
